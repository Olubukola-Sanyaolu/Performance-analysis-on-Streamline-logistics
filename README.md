# Business Problem
---
Streamine logistics solution has several pressing challenges within their order fulfilment process such as mounting order backlogs,visibility gap i.e. customer often find themselves lacking realtime updates on their order progress leading to communication gaps and rising dissatisfaction,cutomer frustration,escalating cost due to overtime payment and the necessity for expedited shipping to clear order backlogs.




# Overview
---
The streamline logistics solution dashboad provides a comprehensive view of the performance of the logistics operation for the year 2017. The dashboard highlights severalkey metrics,including average delivery time,order status,customer feedback, and average delay by zone,route,driver, and order allocation.

# Exploratory data analysis
---
- How many orders are currently backlogged?
- What is the average delay for the delivery?
- which delivery zone experience the highest average delay?
- What is the distribution of the customer feedback?
- How many orders are allocated using "expedited rules or custom"?

# Tool used
---
Excel was used for data cleaning and data visualization.

# Key insights
---
- Order backlog issue: There was a significant backlog of 767 out of 1500, this suggests that the logistics is     struggling to keep up with demand.
- Delivery delay: The overall average delay across all order is approximately 14.51 mins while seems modest, it can accumulate and contribute to the mounting backlog
- Feedback and delay: interestingly order with positive feedback have a slightly higher average delay than negative feedback. This suggest that while delay is a concern other factor such as customer service, product quality or communication could be influencing feedback.
- Driverâ€™s performance: Certain drivers notably D86, D44, D29 have significantly higher average delay than others. This suggests potential areas for training, route optimization or vehicle maintenance.
- 	Route delay: Some route, especially route 3,1,2 consistently show higher delay investigating the route for common obstacles, traffic pattern or longer distance.
- 	Allocation Rules inefficiencies: Despite the intention to expedite deliveries, orders allocated using expedite rule have a slightly higher delay compare to those using Standard rules and custom rules. This might be inefficient in expedited rule allocation system

# Recommendations
---
-  Improve Order Processing Efficiency: Implement strategies to streamline order processing, reduce manual tasks, and improve data accuracy. This could involve automating certain processes, investing in advanced technology, and optimizing workflows.
-  Enhance Route Optimization: Utilize route optimization software to plan efficient delivery routes, minimize travel time, and reduce fuel costs. This can help to improve delivery times and reduce the backlog of orders.
-  Invest in Real-Time Tracking: Implement real-time tracking technology to provide customers with visibility into their order status and estimated delivery times. This can help to improve customer satisfaction and reduce inquiries.
-  Strengthen Communication Channels: Improve communication channels with customers to keep them informed about order status and any potential delays. This can help to mitigate customer frustration and build trust.
-  Analyze Root Causes of Delays: Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the root causes of order delays. This could involve examining factors such as inadequate staffing, equipment failures, or inefficient processes. Once the root causes are identified, targeted solutions can be implemented to address them.
-   Review allocation rules: the expedited rules may need a review to ensure they are effectively reducing delays. It might be more efficient to focus on improving custom rule since they seem to perform better.
-   Driver Training and evaluation: Drivers with consistently high delays might benefit from additional training, better route, planning tools or vehicle maintenance task.

By implementing these recommendations, the Streamline Logistics Solution can address the mounting order backlog, improve visibility, enhance customer satisfaction, and mitigate escalating costs.
